# 👋 Hi, I am Shreyas G Palimar

👀 I’m interested in backend development, cloud deployment, and building scalable microservices, but I am eager to learn new frameworks and technologies to be adaptable and resourceful, as the team requires.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spring Boot, Docker, and exploring cloud platforms like AWS to understand how to deploy real-world applications.
- 📫 How to reach me:

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting — I recently integrated an email classification module into my own apps to learn how they work under the hood.
